# Advent of Code 2020 by norbitrial 🎄👨‍💻

This repository is made for participating in [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) event.

See below my solutions separated by day:

- [Day 01](/day01.ts)

## Guide to use 📙

After cloning the repository run the following commands:

- `npm install` to install required dependencies
- `npm run build` to build all the _TypeScript_ files
- `npm start` to build and run the application

The build command will place all the complied _JavaScript_ files in the `dist` folder.
