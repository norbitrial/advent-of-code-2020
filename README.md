This repository is made for participating in [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) event.

## Guide to use 📙

After cloning the repository run the following commands:

- `npm install` to install required dependencies

The build command will place all the complied _JavaScript_ files in the `dist` folder.
